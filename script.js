// The Password Generator will provide a password with 8-128 characters based on criteria the user specifies.
// GIVEN I need a new, secure password
// WHEN I click the button to generate a password
// THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
// WHEN prompted for password criteria
// THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
// WHEN prompted for the length of the password
// THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
// WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
// THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
// WHEN I answer each prompt
// THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
// WHEN all prompts are answered
// THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
// WHEN the password is generated
// THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

//Assignment Code + Event Listener to prompt questions when the Generate button is pushed
